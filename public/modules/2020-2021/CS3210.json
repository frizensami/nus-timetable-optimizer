{"acadYear":"2020/2021","description":"The aim of this module is to provide an introduction to the field of parallel computing with hands-on parallel programming experience on real parallel machines. The module is divided into four parts: parallel computation models and parallelism, parallel architectures, parallel algorithm design and programming, and new parallel computing models. Topics includes: theory of parallelism and models; shared-memory architectures; distributed-memory architectures; data parallel architectures; interconnection networks, topologies and basic of communication operations; principles of parallel algorithm design; performance\nand scalability of parallel programs, overview of new parallel computing models such as grid, cloud, GPGPU.","title":"Parallel Computing","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","workload":[2,1,0,3,4],"prerequisite":"CS2100 or CG2007 or CG2028 or EE2024 or EE2028","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CS3210","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"4","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-B102","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":16,"covidZone":"C"},{"classNo":"3","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1400","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-B102","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":16,"covidZone":"C"},{"classNo":"2","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-B102","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":16,"covidZone":"C"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1600","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"COM1-B102","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Tutorial","size":16,"covidZone":"C"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1400","endTime":"1600","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Monday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":80,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["C","Unknown"],"examDate":"2020-11-30T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"or":["CS2100","CG2007","CG2028","EE2024","EE2028"]},"fulfillRequirements":["CS4231","CS4223","CS6285"]}
